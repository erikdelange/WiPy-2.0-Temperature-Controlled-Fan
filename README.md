# WiPy 2.0 Temperature Controlled Fan
PWM fans with temperature based speed control which can be placed on a central heating convector, with a JavaScript based web interface.

### Summary
Central heating systems with condensing boilers operate more efficiently if the return water temperature is below 55Â°C ([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensing_boiler)). One way to extract more heat from a radiator is having fans which blow cold air past it. Not only does this lower the temperature of the return water, it also warms up rooms faster. This project presents a solution where a WiPy is used to control these fans, where the fan speed depends on the temperature of the incoming water. The parameters which control the fan are editable via a web-based user interface.

I have installed this on top of the main convector (which is lowered in a pit) in my living room. Seven PWM controlled fans - normally used for cooling PC's - pull cold air through the convector.

### Operating Principle
The fans should only operate if the central heating is working. Therefor a temperature sensor is attached to the incoming water pipe of the convector. If its temperature is above the threshold temperature the fans start rotating using the start duty cycle. The warmer the incoming water becomes the more the duty cycle moves towards the end duty cycle. Depending on your preference the start duty cycle can be the lowest or the highest value. For low temperature heating you want to extract as much warmth from the convector as possible, so set the start duty cycle to the highest value. For a traditional (high temperature) heating system the start duty cycle can be set to the lowest value. When checking if the fans must be stopped a small hysteresis is used to avoid unwanted frequent switching.

### HTML and JavaScript
The user interface can be found in *index.html*. It uses the W3.CSS framework for formatting the web page. The status panel shows the actual temperature of the in- and outgoing water in the convector and the current duty cycle of the fans. The settings panel allows you to change the parameters of the controlling algorithm.

Interaction with the server is done using JavaScript's fetch API. After loading the webpage all fields in the UI are initially filled after a call to /api/init (see *onLoadEvent()*). Every 30 seconds the status fields are refreshed (*setInterval()*) with a call to /api/status. After changing one of the settings fields its new value is sent to the server via /api/set. Every interaction with the server expects a JSON response, except when calling /api/reset or /api/stop.

Use F12 on Chrome and have a look the messages printed in the console.

The reset button on the UI is useful when a new version of the software has been transferred the WiPy using FTP. It allows you to restart the WiPy from a distance - and thus activate the new software - after it has been uploaded.

### Python Code
The fans are controlled by a daemon process (*controller_daemon()*) which measures the temperature of the incoming water regularly and then adjusts the fan speed. The parameters for the speed control algorithm are stored in NVRAM so they are retained after a reset. An [HTTP server](https://github.com/erikdelange/MicroPython-HTTP-Server) is used to communicate with the UI. Commands are received from the client via HTTP's query string, and responses from server to client use JSON. The code for the HTTP server (and for the [logging](https://github.com/erikdelange/MicroPython-Logging) module) is not part of this repository and must be downloaded separately.

### Hardware
![circuit.png](https://github.com/erikdelange/WiPy-2.0-Temperature-Controlled-Fan/blob/master/circuit.png)
The heart of the controller is a WiPy 2.0. Attached are two (at least one is mandatory) DS18x20 temperature sensors. One measures the temperature of the incoming water, the other (optional) one the temperature of the outgoing water. Pycom's library *onewire.py* is used to retrieve the readings from these sensors, which are connected to P21. The WiPy's PWM API is used to control the speed of PWM controlled computer case fans (I've used Arctic PWM PST fans which have an additional connector to allow daisy chaining of up to 4 fans). A daemon process checks the water temperature every 30 seconds and adjusts the fan speed. As the WiPy cannot drive a PWM fan directly (3V3 vs 5V) BS170 FETs are used as driver. A fan's PWM pin expects an external open collector/drain circuit which can sink 5V. Although a BS170 can officially not be opened completely at a 3V3 gate voltage it did work OK for me. Because the Arctic documentation specifies only 4 fans can be daisy chained two PWM outputs are used (P22 and P23).

The actual PCB for this project looks like:

The PCB consist mostly of connectors. Note that a 7805 voltage regulator is attached to an aluminum profile for cooling. Bringing down the 12V for the PWM fans to 5V for the WiPy (at some 100mA) does generate some heat. A 5mm jack plug for an external 12V DC power supply is also connected to the aluminum profile, as this provides a sturdy base.

The stripboard design is:

I've put the stripboard on a wooden base. This base itself has two neodymium magnets underneath (not visible here) so I can attach it easily to my metal convector.

The three-pin headers connect to the DS18x20 sensors, the four-pin headers to the PWM fans. This is not the most efficient design from space perspective but for me big enough to be handled comfortable, and requires only a limited number of connecting wires.

### Overkill
Yes, this is absolutely not the lowest cost solution for this problem. A temperature controlled switch like the W1209 is much cheaper and does not require any programming at all. However my solution was - at least to me - more fun as I like programming and had the WiPy in stock anyhow. Remember the law of the instrument: "for a man with a hamer (= a WiPy) every problem looks like a nail" :)
